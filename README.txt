SMPP Client Library - open source SMPP v3.4 Protocol implementation.

The home page is https://sourceforge.net/projects/smppclient

Features:
	1. All kind of PDUs and TLVs implementation. All PDUs protocol compliance check.
	2. Two levels of abstraction for interaction with SMSC: Session and Client, for fine-grained control.
	3. SMPP session with SMSC automatically recovered on error.


Notice: There are a lot of junit tests, so library build may take up to 5 minutes.
Notice: Some javadoc comments still in Russia, but I'll fix this soon.
